# DPSFloatingLabelTextField
Floating label for UITextField

Implements the "Float Label Pattern" for iOS.
See Matt D. Smith's design: http://dribbble.com/shots/1254439--GIF-Mobile-Form-Interaction?list=users

There are many frameworks for iOS that provide this functionality:
- JVFloatLabeledTextField - https://github.com/jverdi/JVFloatLabeledTextField
- or just search CocoaPods - https://cocoapods.org/?q=floatlabel

This framework is designed to be **storyboard-friendly** (in fact, storyboards are
required!) There are some advantages to setting up the view in storyboards:
- Position your textfield and label in the _visible_ state, so you know how much top-clearance to leave above the text field.
- Tweak appearance properties for the label in Interface Builder.
