# DPSFloatingLabelTextField
Floating label for UITextField

Implements the "Float Label Pattern" for iOS.
See Matt D. Smith's design: http://dribbble.com/shots/1254439--GIF-Mobile-Form-Interaction?list=users

There are many frameworks for iOS that provide this functionality:
- JVFloatLabeledTextField - https://github.com/jverdi/JVFloatLabeledTextField
- or just search CocoaPods - https://cocoapods.org/?q=floatlabel

This framework is designed to be *storyboard-friendly* (in fact, storyboards are
required!)
